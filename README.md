<h2> :question: About the project</h2>
Based on the blog post from Sage Jenson: https://cargocollective.com/sagejenson/physarum

Written using the OpenGL binding ModernGL in python and uses the library's GPU parallelization capabilities to speed up performance enough to support over 1 million individual slime particles when running on a GTX 1060 6GB.
